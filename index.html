<img src = "https://web.archive.org/web/20010831103755im_/http://inventorymaster.com:80/whyinventory.gif" /> <p>Life is full of uncertainties.  Your assets could be gone by this time tomorrow.  Protect yourself from the unexpected: earthquakes, fires, floods, theft, vandalism, false claims or just furniture-eating dogs by investing a small amount of time and energy into inventorying all of your belongings with InventoryMaster™.  You'll be glad you did.</p>  

<h2>I don't really have that much stuff...</h2>

<p>You might be surprised!  If you had to itemize all of your personal possessions, what dollar amount would you place on them?  Most people grossly underestimate the value  of the contents of their residence, and end up not getting properly compensated for those losses when they occur.</p>  

<h2>My bedroom is worth HOW MUCH?!!</h2>

<p>Would you believe that just your bedroom could have over $5,000 in personal possessions hiding in it?  When you start adding up each article of clothing, footwear, outdoor wear, bedding, small furniture, electronics and decorations, the total cost of these items starts accumulating dramatically.  Without a detailed list of these items, you could be seriously undervaluing the total worth of this small portion of your belongings and short-change yourself should you need to replace them!</p>

<h2>InventoryMasterTM was designed to accommodate many different types of people living in a wide variety of living environments, and do it affordably.</h2>

<p>Whether you live in a house, apartment, condominium, dormitory, mobile home or nursing home, InventoryMasterTM can help you manage your possessions quickly and easily.

		<h2>How Do I Care For My Flytrap?</h2>
		<p>Give Venus fly traps as much light as you can. Full direct sunlight at least four hours a day is best, though Venus fly traps can flourish under strong artificial lighting as well. Water them with “pure” water (low in mineral content), either distilled, rain water, or other water that has a low concentration of dissolved solids. For optimal growth, do not keep Venus fly traps sitting in water.  They prefer to have their soil always damp, never dry, and not too wet for too long.  And plant Venus flytraps in a proper mix of nutrient poor medium. Most people use peat, sphagnum moss, sand and perlite in some combination.  Long fiber sphagnum moss works well for Venus fly trap soil too.</p>
		<p>If possible, keep the ambient humidity high, though this is not critical. Venus Fly Traps can thrive in low humidity. Just be sure to keep their soil damp at all times when the humidity is low.</p>
		<p>If you are growing your plant in less than ideal conditions, or you just want the biggest traps possible, it’s best to not let them flower. Try to cut the flower stalk off as soon as you notice it. Flowering robs the plant of precious energy that it could otherwise use to make itself larger or produce better leafs and traps. Also, as a flytrap grows, it will often form little offshoots with a second rosette or multiple rosettes of leaves. These offshoots will eventually form their own root systems. When you go to repot your venus fly trap you can gently pry the rosettes apart and have separate Venus fly traps. If you cut the flower off, the Venus flytrap will be more likely to divide and form separate rosettes through the growing season due to the fact it can put more energy into growing.</p>

		<p>Adequate lighting is very important to keeping a Dionaea muscipula healthy. During their active growing season, Venus Fly Traps should receive a minimum of 12 hours of light (also known as a 12 hour photoperiod) with a minimum of 4 hours of direct sunlight, if you’re growing your Venus Flytraps outside. In general, the more direct light the plant receives the healthier the plant will be.</p>
		<p>The best place to grow Venus Fly Traps is outside year round. If you do this, choose an open area to put your plants in and you won’t have to worry about making sure that the plant gets adequate light. They will get all the light that they need. In an extremely hot and dry climate, it is best to provide some shelter from mid-day sun so that Venus fly traps don’t get burned or desiccated (dried out).  A simple 50% shade cloth will work well, or dappled light through the leaves of a tree will also provide some reprieve from the intense sun while still providing adequate light for optimal health.</p>

		<p>Using pure water is essential to the health of a Venus Fly Trap. In general, tap water will not be good for Venus fly traps and can quickly lead to poor health and death. The minerals dissolved in tap water, commonly called dissolved solids, namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium, are detrimental to the health of your Venus Flytrap. Although it may not be immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and eventually death of the plant.</p>
		<p>Venus Fly Traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an RO system). However regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a TDS measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for Venus Flytraps and other carnivorous plants. Although higher levels of TDS can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.</p>

		<p>It is very important to use nutrient POOR soil to grow Venus Flytraps. Regular potting soil will burn the roots and kill the plant very quickly. Fertilizing Venus Fly Traps is also not recommended. The fertilizer will burn the roots and likely kill the plant. Some experts use extremely diluted fertilizer and apply it only to the leaves of the plant, but this is risky for a beginner and not recommended.

Dionaea aren’t terribly picky about the medium you use. Perhaps the easiest medium to use is simply pure, unenriched (NO Miracle-Gro!) peat moss or long fiber sphagnum moss. Peat moss is typically sold in large bales at most retailers that carry potting soil. It seems that the most widely accepted medium to use when potting Venus fly traps is a 1:1 mix (in terms of volume) of peat and perlite. When choosing a brand of peat moss, any type will do as long as it isn’t enriched. <strong>Be sure to avoid brands like Miracle-Gro and Scott’s because they contain fertilizer that will burn the roots of your plant and eventually kill it.</strong></p>
